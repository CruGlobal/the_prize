Now for me personally having this pressure is just trusting the Lord. The Bible says “Cast your cares on him for he cares”. When I understand that the life I am living is no more my own. It is a life he has died for. He has exchanged his life for my life and has given me a life of peace and a life of joy to life for, then I live beyond myself. I live beyond what people say, beyond what people think. I focus more on what the Lord says about me."
