      col1: When I was 16 and playing for Palmeiras, I was not sure if I had a future there. ... UP to then I had only really thought about football but the disapppointment that my football life was not working out caused me to think about bigger questions. I talked to my brother about faith and about what the purpose of life was. I had always belived in God but without having a relationship with him. I knew I needed ... God's love and I decided to live my life for him.
      col2: Many people think they have to perform to earn God's love. He has shown me that the absolute opposite is the case and he accepts me just as I am. All he wants from me is that I give him my heart and my life. I am really thankful for that.

      col1: Talking about pressure which we encounter, I believe this pressure is for everybody. I believe everyone at every level goes through some pressure. The same at different stages. Now for me personally having this pressure is just trusting the Lord. The Bible says “Cast your cares on him for he cares”. When I understand that the life I am living is no more my own. It is a life he has died for. He has exchanged his life for my life and has given me a life of peace and a life of joy to life for, then I live beyond myself. I live beyond what people say, beyond what people think. I focus more on what the Lord says about me.
      col2: "... a friend of mine from school spoke to me about the Lord Jesus. ... and it just came to me like reality. He talked to my heart, he touched my heart and the gospel became very real to me. Ever since that day, I have just been in love with Jesus."

      col1: When you hear your name called on the team sheet, on a match day - the excitement, the energy that goes through your body. This is what it is all about for me and to play well that first game, to play well the second game and to know that I was starting to have the confidence and belief from my team-mates and coaches.
      col2: For me, how my personal life, my faith life and my sport life - they all come together. I think they have to. I think that is just natural. You don't have one without the other and most importantly you have to have Jesus in your life. It hasn't always been a rosy road to success. There are always going to be bumps along the way, and through the difficulties, Jesus is what helped me get through all of those struggles.

      col1: Every time I play a game I honor Jesus's name ... I belive that Jesus has nothing to do with money, with fame and with success. Those were a gift that He gave me, the gift of playing soccer. I truly believe he does not care much for Kaká "the soccer player". He is worried about Ricardo. Who I am, and the person that I am.
      col2: I have been through great moments in my career, and I have gone through hard moments as well, both in my career and my personal life. In all those moments I could count on God. In my prayers, and in the Bible, the word of God, with friends that share the same Faith as I do. To know that regardless of the situation, if its good or bad, that there is a God that loves us, and that makes the whole difference to me.

      col1: I had no idea what playing for the national team was. You hear about it; you read about it. Now you put yourself in a position where you are ready to be criticized. Everything you do - good or bad - is going to be criticized and you are going to have someone say something about it. "I used to ask God so many times, 'Why is this happening to me when I come to you, pray to you?' So why is all this happening to me and everyone else is OK? What did I do to deserve this? For me it is always why. Stop with the why." First of all I learned the biggest thing that you are not in control. No matter how much you try you are not in control of things that happen. If I did not have Jesus I would be lost. I would be completely lost.
      col2: I know my strength does not come from me. It comes from above. ... God won't take you to the next level if you don't know how to handle the pressure. The higher you go the worse it becomes. The higher you go every time you miss one ball, you have thousands of people calling you names or calling you stupid, and when you score you have millions saying you are the greatest. I am not going to sit here and lie and say, "I live a perfect, God-fearing life". I have problems sometimes. My faith is tested ... You have so many challenges. You have so many things that come to you. You want someone to talk to.
